Creating a smart metering system for real-time monitoring and analysis of energy consumption involves multiple components, such as data collection, storage, processing, and display. Below is a simplified Python program that simulates such a system. It reads energy consumption data from a simulated meter, stores it, analyzes the data to find consumption patterns, and displays the results. The program includes appropriate comments and error handling:

```python
import random
import time
import statistics

class SmartMeter:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize with an empty list to store power consumption data
        self.data = []
        
    def read_data(self):
        # Simulated real-time data reading (0 to 5 kWh in this example)
        consumption = round(random.uniform(0, 5), 2)
        self.data.append(consumption)
        return consumption
    
    def display_data(self):
        # Display the last 10 entries of consumption data
        print("Recent consumption data:", self.data[-10:])
    
    def analyze_data(self):
        # Perform basic data analysis
        try:
            avg_consumption = statistics.mean(self.data)
            max_consumption = max(self.data)
            min_consumption = min(self.data)

            print("\nData Analysis:")
            print(f"Average Consumption: {avg_consumption:.2f} kWh")
            print(f"Max Consumption: {max_consumption:.2f} kWh")
            print(f"Min Consumption: {min_consumption:.2f} kWh")
        except statistics.StatisticsError as e:
            print("Error in data analysis:", e)
    
    def run(self):
        try:
            while True:
                new_data = self.read_data()
                print(f"New data: {new_data} kWh")
                self.display_data()
                time.sleep(2)  # Simulate delay in data reading
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("\nStopping the Smart Meter...")
            print("Performing final analysis before shutdown.")
            self.analyze_data()
        except Exception as e:
            print("An unexpected error occurred:", e)

def main():
    print("Starting Smart Meter System...\n")
    smart_meter = SmartMeter()
    
    try:
        smart_meter.run()
    except Exception as e:
        print("An error occurred while running the Smart Meter:", e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Program Explanation:
- **SmartMeter Class**: This class handles the core functionality of the smart metering system.
  - **`__init__`**: Initializes the data storage list.
  - **`read_data`**: Simulates reading new consumption data randomly between 0 and 5 kWh.
  - **`display_data`**: Displays the last 10 data entries to provide real-time updates.
  - **`analyze_data`**: Analyzes the collected data to provide average, max, and min consumption values.
  - **`run`**: Continuously reads data, displays it, and waits, allowing for real-time simulation. It also handles a graceful exit with data analysis on termination.
  
- **Error Handling**: 
  - Basic error handling is covered using try-except blocks for potential issues during statistics calculation and running the loop.
  - An error message is printed if an unexpected situation occurs.

- **Execution Flow**: 
  - The `main` function initializes and starts the smart meter system.
  - The program continuously runs until interrupted (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C), producing real-time consumption data.

This simplified program should provide a foundation for a smart metering system where you can further enhance functionalities like data persistence, a more sophisticated simulation, or a user interface.
